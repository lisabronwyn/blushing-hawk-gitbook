We encountered some pauses where we needed to supplement our existing knowledge. Here are the resources that we used to complete our project promptly.

Please note that there were many issues involving configuration in getting GitBooks to work with GitHub. There were many permissions issues, branch issues, and more. TheLady and I agreed that if you're looking for a robust and user intuitive platform to host your book, documentation, blogs, and more, that this is not the platform that you're looking for.

The integration problems that we had throughout the week were constant and plentiful. There were a lot of missing pieces between GitHub and GitBook and they interfered with collaboration rather than supporting it.

The goal of the project was to work around the integration problems and develop a workflow that took those into consideration.

# A Note on Blogs and Databases

Although GitBook has some improvements to make before becoming a useful tool for collaborating with another person, it still works as a blog hosting solution. If you are using GitBook, you can put your blog on the Web without using Heroku or manually setting up hosting. However, if you are hosting your own blog, you might consider using Javascript and/or Python to store your blog contents in a SQL database.

For this project, we initially considered PostgreSQL as the database to use. So far, most of the tutorials I reviewed suggest Python frameworks such as Django and Flask, just as Javascript tutorials recommended Express, for example. I recommend SQLite database for Python and ExpressJS for Javascript, to start.

Happy blogging!

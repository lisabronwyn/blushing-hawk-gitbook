***TESTING***

My recently completed first course on FEM is Introduction to JavaScript and jQuery.

**Note:** _This course (came out in 2012) is still valuable, but has been superseded by our comprehensive, Introduction to Web Development course._

In this Introduction to jQuery and JavaScript video workshop, Karl Swedberg is the instructor.

The videos are 3–12 minutes in length. Between each video are effects, animations, and music that reminded me of CodeSchool.

jQuery lets you dive in and go from beginner to advanced in a short amount of time. With excellent documentation, jQuery is efficient for developers. It helps you write consistent code that works well.

At its core, jQuery is a simple concept that reduces browser inconsistencies.

Nearly everything written in jQuery begins with $. For example, you can target every element on a page with $(‘div’). This method applies to other selectors as well.

$(‘div’) is the equivalent of JavaScript’s getElementsByTagName(‘div’) function. Seeing these examples side by side reinforced my knowledge, syntactically.

Elements ‘listen’ for actions by the user. Other actions include communicating with a server, and manipulating and animating elements.

JavaScript works with strings (textual content with “double” or ‘single’ quotes around them), numbers (integers and more), booleans (true or false), arrays (simple lists indexed using []), and objects (lists of key, value pairs appearing within {}).

The index of an array always starts with 0. Nested arrays have strings, numbers, etc.

Information is stored in an object: {name: [‘Lisa’], loves: [‘sushi’]}.

Let’s move onto conditionals and operators. Conditionals include if, else, and else if statements and the switch statement.

Arithmetic operators include: +, -, *, %, ++,- -.
Note that in addition to add, the + sign concatenates (links things together in a chain or series).

Comparison operators include: >, <, ==, !=, ≥, ≤, ===, ==, and !==.

The crucial difference between (double equals == ) vs. (triple equals ===) is that == means ‘equal to’ whereas === means ‘equal value’ AND ‘equal type’. When you use != vs. !==, != means ‘not equal to’ whereas !== is ‘not equal value’ OR ‘not equal type’.

Some operators in JavaScript include assignment operators, bitwise operators, conditional (ternary) operators, typeof operators, and logical operators.

Logical operators include: ! (bang aka not), && (and), and || (or).

Loops iterate through lists. JavaScript helps you build lists(collections), so you can do something with each item in the list.

CSS uses implicit iteration, and JavaScript uses explicit iteration. jQuery can do both!

Most common are the ‘for’ and the ‘for in’ loops. There’s also the ‘while’ and ‘do..while’ loops. The for loop has three statements (1. initial value, 2. the condition, 3. how to increment).

With a function, you name and define a block of code to use later. Functions can be defined with parameters and then called with arguments.

Every function has an arguments object. It’s a collection of arguments passed to the function when called. It allows for a variable number of arguments.

Functions can also be named or anonymous. You can also run functions WITHIN functions. I accidentally discovered this in the enrollment game for Learners Guild, much to my delight.

If you’re considering FrontEnd Masters, I found this preview video to be helpful. It’s from this specific course.

Most functions are anonymous in jQuery. Anonymous functions create closures, are used as callback functions, and can be used as object properties. Functions can be passed as arguments, too.

Almost everything in JavaScript is an object, except for numbers, strings, and booleans. Those are primitive data types and have object wrappers.

Objects include RegExp (regular expression) objects, global objects, date objects, math objects, RegExp string objects, and more.

To access properties of an object, you can use dot notation and array notation. JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It’s a format for passing data back and forth.

Regarding script referencing: it’s crucial to add your style sheets AFTER you put the script tags in your document. Reference custom scripts AFTER you add the jQuery core code.

Reference plugins should be included in the jQuery core and custom scripts. Scripts should be referenced in between the <head></head> tags or before the </body> tag.

jQuery can be downloaded from the jQuery site or referenced with a CDN (content delivery network). You can find CDNs on jQuery, Microsoft, and Google.

In the syntax for CSS selectors, you’ll see the difference between #navigation and $(‘#navigation’). The first is regular CSS, but the second is its jQuery equivalent. Wrapped in quotes as a string, it’s then contained in brackets after the $.

There are other selectors in jQuery that include CSS attribute selectors and custom form selectors.

Traversal in jQuery means that you can find HTML elements as they relate to their position.

jQuery extends your ability to move in many directions with traversal, rather than the limitations of using CSS selectors.
